Q. 172: As a test leader you are collecting measures about defects. You recognize that after the first test cycle � covering all requirements – subsystem C has a defect density that is 150% higher than the average. Subsystem A on the other hand has a defect density that is 60% lower than the average. What conclusions for the next test cycle could you draw from this fact?

A. It is probable that subsystem C has still more hidden defects. Therefore we need to test subsystem C in more detail.
